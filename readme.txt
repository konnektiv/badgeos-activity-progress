== Description ==

Adds a shortcode to show a progress bar for the users current activity points.

**Note:** You will need to install the free [BadgeOS plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/badgeos/ "BadgeOS")&trade; (version 1.2 or higher) to use the BadgeOS Community Add-on.

[Get the BadgeOS plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/badgeos/ "BadgeOS").

[BadgeOS](http://badgeos.org "BadgeOS")&trade; turns your WordPress site into an achievement and badging system. And with BuddyPress enabled on your site, achievements are not only awarded by demonstrating skills and knowledge, but also by participating in community activities. Define the achievements, organize the badge requirements any way you like, and choose from and combine a range of assessment and community activity options to determine whether each task or requirement has been achieved.

Earned badges are Mozilla OBI compatible and sharable via [Credly](https://credly.com/ "Credly.com"), the free web service for recognizing and displaying lifelong achievement.

= Extensibility and Additional BadgeOS Add-ons =

* BadgeOS is designed to be a true operating system for turning any WordPress site into an engagement management application.
* Built with expandability in mind to allow virtually anything to trigger and recognize achievement.
* BadgeOS plans to continue to release a range of Add-Ons to the plugin -- like the BadgeOS Community Add-on -- that enhance core functionality with specialized functions.
* Check out some of the [BadgeOS customizations](http://badgeos.org/services/badgeos-customization/ "We'll help you customize your BadgeOS site") we've already implemented to get a sense for what you might expect.
